E-ÅŒke is short for "Empty Orchestra" (or more aptly - Electronic Orchestra) which is the original Japanese term for Karaoke. 

My first attempt at making a full-stack application with ReactJS and Node.

A clone of Kyle's Spotify tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcet6msf3eE&t=723s) but with a custom playlist functionality (without using a Spotify SDK).

In the future it may include:
- Dynamic rendering of "Official Music Video" using YouTube's API
- Dynamic scrolling of lyrics for current song (currently unable to access Spotify's Playback Controller state values necessary to do so)

Currently having difficulties finding and deploying the app into a production site.
